# K-Means-Clusturing
implement K-mwans Clusturing from scrach to train it on MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and display some digits of similar cluster
we also optimise assignment of the initial centeroids by using sorting the lengths of position vector from origin rather than assigning them randomly.
